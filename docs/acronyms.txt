BMU broadcast, multicast, and unknown traffic
Traffic that is not unicast. Any nature of multipoint traffic:
• broadcast (that is, all 1s as the destination IP to 
represent all destinations within the subnet)
• multicast (that is, traffic typically identified by the 
destination address, uses special destination 
address); for IP, the destination must be 224.0.0.0 to 
239.255.255.255
• unknown (that is, the destination is typically a valid 
unicast address but the destination port/interface is 
not yet known; therefore, traffic needs to be 
forwarded to all destinations; unknown traffic is 
treated as broadcast)
